            <P> The New Year brought new transportation choices and some much needed hope for Yorkville residents and businesses who survived the decades of Second Avenue construction. </p>

            <p> Three new subway stations opened for service along Second Avenue on January 1, extending Q train service north to 96th Street. Numbers released by the MTA show that riders have taken to the train in its first two full months of operation.</p>



            <p>According to the MTA, approximately 200,000 people ride the new train everyday. The large number of riders is helping to ease the notoriously over-crowded Lexington Avenue Line. The Lexington Line has seen a 13% decrease in riders on average.For
                many years, the Lexington Avenue Line was an essential route as the only north-south subway east of Central Park. The line connects riders from the Bronx and Harlem to Manhattan and Brooklyn or vice-versa. </p>

                “I love the new Q Train,” said Upper East resident Brandon Xudong, “it’s perfect if you need to get down and across town.” Xudong said before he had to take a train down Lexington then transfer to get across town.
            </p>

            <p>The influx of people traveling along Second Avenue is also bringing more people into local businesses. “We’ve seen a ton more foot traffic in January and February,” said Danielle Scalora, general manager of Luke’s Lobster on 81st Street. Scalora
                said that the winter is normally her slow season but the new foot traffic has helped increase sales from last year. </p>

            <p>The new access to transportation is also expected to bring a sharp increase in rent for the area. According to real estate website StreetEasy, rent along Second Avenue rose nearly 27 percent, doubling the Third Avenue rate. The website also
                predicts rent increases of over $450 a month for areas along the new subway. </p>
